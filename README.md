## Projects
- [**Personnel Analysis Agent**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Personnel-AI-Agent) - Data analytics and visualization multi-agent that creates data products based on personnel metrics. Deployed in Azure. STAY TUNED - IN PROGRESS.  
- [**RAG ChatBot**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/repo) - Azure deployed RAG grounded chat bot using vector retrieval for company documentation. 
- [**Document Translation App**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/repo) - Azure deployed app allowing document upload, auto translation, and download in ten languages. Maintains document structure.
- [**Adverse Drug Reactions ML Classification with NLP**](https://github.com/teamlunarlanding/repo) - Trained and deployed random forest model using Sagemaker in AWS. Model predicts patient risk of adverse outcomes from pharmaceutical drugs.
- [**Clinical Trial Gender Gaps ML Classifiation with NLP**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Clinical-Trial-Sex-Representation) - NLP project that used clinical trial descriptions in clinicaltrials.gov to classify sex (male/female). Model coefficients correspond to discrepancies between amount of clinical trials conducted in males vs. females. Trained and deployed in Azure. 
- [**Long COVID Cognitive Impairment Regression and Prognosis Outcome Prediction**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/long-COVID) - A variety of ML models related to aspects of long term symptom profiles in COVID survivors. Trained in Sagemaker in AWS. 
- [**Participant Drop Out Classification**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/participant-dropout-classification) - Decision tree model trained in R to identify characteristics of participants who drop out of online research prior to completing all study activities.

## Education
- **Master of Science** in Applied Data Science, University of San Diego
- **Bachelor of Science** in Psychology/Biological Science, San Jose State University
