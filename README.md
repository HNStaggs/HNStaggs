## Projects
- [**Long COVID**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Long-COVID) - Developed and evaluated models using 50 biopsychosocial features to classify long COVID diagnosis and predict cognitive complaint severity. Analyzed long COVID biotypes using k-means clustering of symptom profiles.
- [**Gender Gaps in Clinical Trials**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Clinical-Trial-Gender-Gaps) - Use natural language processing (NLP) of registered clinical trial descriptions (clinicaltrials.gov API) to assess differences in sex representation using classification model coefficients.
- [**Participant Dropout Factors**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Participant-Dropout-Classification) - Created a decision tree classifier to identify demographics of participants likely to drop out of online research.
- [**COVID Economic Database**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/COVID_Economic_Database) - Created an ETL pipeline of covid-related, global, macroeconomic data.
- [**Pharmaceutical Drug Surveillance**](https://github.com/teamlunarlanding/Pharma-Drug-Surveillance) - Created an ETL pipeline of adverse drug event information to create a database that supports machine learning objectives, dashboarding, and model deployment via Streamlit application.
- [**Political Discourse Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Political-Discourse-NLP-AWS) - Leveraged AWS cloud computing and natural language processing to capture public sentiment of presidential candidates from Twitter tweets and New York Times article comments.
