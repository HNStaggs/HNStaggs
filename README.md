## Projects

### LLM Applications
- [**Personnel Analysis Agent - Azure**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Research-Chat-RAG) - IO psychology research and personnel data analytics visualization multi-agent that creates data products based on HR data. Deployed in Azure. Uses RAG, web searching, dataset uploads.

### ML Models
- [**Adverse Drug Reactions ML Classification with NLP**](https://github.com/teamlunarlanding/Pharma-Drug-Surveillance) - Trained and deployed random forest model in Streamlit. Dashboard in PowerBI. Model classifies patient risk of adverse outcomes from pharmaceutical drugs.
- [**Clinical Trial Gender Gaps ML Classifiation with NLP**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Clinical-Trial-Gender-Gaps) - NLP project that used clinical trial descriptions in clinicaltrials.gov to classify sex (male/female). Model coefficients correspond to discrepancies between amount of clinical trials conducted in males vs. females.
- [**Long COVID Cognitive Impairment Regression, Diangosis Classification, and Symptom Clustering**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/long-COVID-ml) - A variety of ML models related to aspects of long term symptom profiles in COVID survivors.

### Statistics & Explanatory Models
- [**Clinical Trial Analysis**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/rct-statistics) - Primary aims analysis plan of a randomized clinical trial coded in R.   
- [**Participant Drop Out Classification**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/participant-dropout-classification) - Explanatory decision tree model trained in R to identify characteristics of participants who drop out of online research prior to completing all study activities.
- [**AB Test**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/AB-Test-Case) - Statistical analysis using Python. Differences in sale conversion rate and time on website between two website versions - original and optimized. Project details methodology and recommendations.  

## Education
