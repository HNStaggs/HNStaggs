## Projects
- [**Personnel Analysis Agent**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Personnel-AI-Agent) - Data analytics and visualization multi-agent that creates data products based on personnel metrics. Deployed in Azure. 
- [**RAG Codebase ChatBot**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/CodeHelperRAG) - An offline generative agent offering code suggestions based on in-house documentation using vector retrieval.
- [**Machine Translator App**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Translate-Demo) - Streamlit deployed app allowing document upload, auto translation, and download in ten languages.
- [**Drug Reaction Classification App**](https://github.com/teamlunarlanding/Pharma-Drug-Surveillance) - Deployed random forest model in a streamlit application that predicts patient risk of adverse outcomes from pharmaceutical drugs.
- [**Clinical Trial Gender Gaps**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/Clinical-Trial-Gender-Gaps) - NLP project that used clinical trial descriptions in clinicaltrials.gov to classify sex (male/female). Model coefficients correspond to discrepancies between amount of clinical trials conducted in males vs. females.
- [**Long COVID Diagnosis Classification, Cognitive Impairment Regression, and Longitudinal Outcome Prediction**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/long-COVID) - A variety of ML models related to aspects of long term symptom profiles in COVID survivors.
- [**Participant Drop Out Classification**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/participant-dropout-classification) - Decision tree model trained in R to identify characteristics of participants who drop out of online research prior to completing all study activities.
