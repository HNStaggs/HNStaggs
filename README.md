## Projects

### LLM Cloud Applications
- [**Personnel Analysis Agent - Azure**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/personnel-AI-agent) - Data analytics and visualization multi-agent that creates data products based on personnel metrics. Deployed in Azure. STAY TUNED - IN PROGRESS.  
- [**RAG ChatBot - Azure**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/rag-chat) - Azure deployed RAG grounded chat bot using vector retrieval for company documentation. 
- [**Document Translation App - Azure**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/document-translation-AI) - Azure deployed app allowing document upload, auto translation, and download in ten languages. Maintains document structure.

### ML Models
- [**Adverse Drug Reactions ML Classification with NLP - AWS**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/adverse-drug-reaction-ml-nlp) - Trained and deployed random forest model using Sagemaker in AWS. Model predicts patient risk of adverse outcomes from pharmaceutical drugs.
- [**Clinical Trial Gender Gaps ML Classifiation with NLP - Azure**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/clinical-trial-sex-representation-ml-nlp) - NLP project that used clinical trial descriptions in clinicaltrials.gov to classify sex (male/female). Model coefficients correspond to discrepancies between amount of clinical trials conducted in males vs. females. Trained and deployed in Azure. 
- [**Long COVID Cognitive Impairment Regression and Prognosis Outcome Prediction - AWS**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/long-COVID-ml) - A variety of ML models related to aspects of long term symptom profiles in COVID survivors. Trained in Sagemaker via S3 data storage in AWS and deployed to Streamlit app.

### Statistics & Explanatory Models
- [**Clinical Trial Analysis**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/rct-statistics) - Primary aims analysis plan of a randomized clinical trial in R. Synthetic data created with VAE to protect original data.    
- [**Participant Drop Out Classification**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/participant-dropout-classification) - Explanatory decision tree model trained in R to identify characteristics of participants who drop out of online research prior to completing all study activities.
- [**AB Test**](https://github.com/HNStaggs/AB-Test-Case) - Statistical analysis of differences in sale conversion rate and time on website between two website versions - original and optimized. Project details methodology and recommendations.
